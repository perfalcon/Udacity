hi
11:04 pm
the items on the y-axis show the actual object
11:04 pm
ok
11:05 pm
the items on the x-axis show what the model predicted that object was
then the numbers in the grid show how many times that combination occured
so the top-left hand corner of the image shows that 4 times when beer existed the classifier correctly predicted it to be beet
*beer

ok
11:06 pm
does it make sense?
11:06 pm
yes ,, if we take plastic_cup (Y) ,
and bowl(x) .. the number indicates 2 ... means ... it predicted as bowl 2times for the plastic cup, right?
11:07 pm
exactly!
11:09 pm
thanks ...
11:09 pm
you're welcome :)

what about the right image ... - Normalized means?
11:09 pm
the left image shows the absolute counts (i.e. it predicted bowl 2 times for plastic cup). The right side shows the same information, but as percentage instead
so 0.4 of the time (40%) it predicted bowl for plastic cup

ok ... now it is more clear for me
thank you for the clarification.
