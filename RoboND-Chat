Problem hi

Attempt can you provide more documentation on confusion matrix .. i didn't understand the image shown in the "Train your SVM"

Hi
11:04 pm
hi
11:04 pm
the items on the y-axis show the actual object
11:04 pm
ok
11:05 pm
the items on the x-axis show what the model predicted that object was
then the numbers in the grid show how many times that combination occured
so the top-left hand corner of the image shows that 4 times when beer existed the classifier correctly predicted it to be beet
*beer
11:05 pm
ok
11:06 pm
does it make sense?
11:06 pm
yes ,, if we take plastic_cup (Y) ,
and bowl(x) .. the number indicates 2 ... means ... it predicted as bowl 2times for the plastic cup, right?
11:07 pm
exactly!
11:09 pm
thanks ...
11:09 pm
you're welcome :)
11:09 pm
what about the right image ... - Normalized means?
11:09 pm
the left image shows the absolute counts (i.e. it predicted bowl 2 times for plastic cup). The right side shows the same information, but as percentage instead
so 0.4 of the time (40%) it predicted bowl for plastic cup
11:11 pm
ok ... now it is more clear for me
thank you for the clarification.

Problem hi

Attempt question on Train your SVM in the picture : what does the bar represents for ? which is number 0.0 to 5.0
11:26 pm
Hi
11:27 pm
hi
11:28 pm
it's just a legend for the confusion matrix colours
11:28 pm
ok
11:28 pm
the maximum number inside the matrix is 5, min is 0
so that is the scale
and shows you which colors are set inside the matrix
11:28 pm
then .. in the quiz ...
"Fraction of the Time" means?
which matrix should i refer to
11:29 pm
fraction of time is same meaning as probability or %
so right hand matrix
11:29 pm
ok wait a sec
Image
can u tell me are these correct ... because when i submit .. i am getting "try again"
11:32 pm
First one is incorrect - check the question again carefully :)
11:33 pm
then third one also should be wrong,?
11:36 pm
third one looks ok
11:37 pm
hmmm... then the value for the first one would be '0' ...plastick_cup(y) - hammer(y),right
?
11:40 pm
no, first one is hammer(y), plastic cup (x)
you got num 3 correct
11:41 pm
ok .. then it is '1'
but it is throwing 'try again'
1.0
11:43 pm
I think the problem is you set 1.0 for the number of times, and 1 for the fraction of time
try swapping those 2
its a little bit picky, but should work...
11:44 pm
ahh ... now it worked thanks....
11:45 pm
awesome!
happy to help :)
